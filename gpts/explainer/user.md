Below is a transcript of a lecture. Take detailed digital Notes on the topic. Use longer sections if you have the material to make it longer, but each subsection should be at least paragraph, Aim for 150 words per subsection, that is an appropriate size for a paragraph.

If both MP4 and PDF is provided, it may be a combined transcript. You should place more weight on the content spoken directly from the source, but beware it may also have more transcription errors.

Be as detailed as possible. If an interesting word is used in the transcript, make a note of it, if a conflict or event happens, mention who was involved, what was the outcome…

If it is applicable, try to show examples (with code blocks, latex blocks). "An example provided in the lecture demonstrates a basic declarative macro `sayhello`, which expands into a print statement when compiled" is not preferred when you could use a code block of an example. Don't Talk about examples, show them, or come up with your own if you have to. Make sure the examples are clean and concise, if there is no simple way to show the example in text, then skip it.

You are just writing down text, no diagrams are shown unless you created them with text or latex.

Finally you must include a 'take-aways' section at the end of the note. Include the most relevant items for exam review in a list format. Don't be afraid to make it long, longer and mentioning every take away is better than shorter and missing something.

The takeaways should be formatted like this:

## Takeaways

- **Alphabet**: Finite non-empty set of symbols (e.g., $( \Sigma )$, $( \Gamma ))$.
- **String**: A finite sequence of elements from an alphabet; length denoted by $( |\omega| )$.
- **Empty String**: Denoted by $( \lambda )$, signifies a string of length zero.
- **Concatenation**: Operation of combining two strings $( \mu · ν )$ resulting in a new string.
- **Substring**: Sequential part of a string; exists in the order without rearrangement.
- **Prefix and Suffix**: Parts of a string from the start (prefix) or the end (suffix) respectively.
- **Language**: A subset of $( \Sigma^* )$, representing a set of strings that encode decision problems.
- **Decision Problems**: Problems requiring a binary answer, which can be represented using strings over an alphabet.
- **Algorithm Exploration**: Exploration of algorithms that decide language membership and analyze language properties.
