Below is a transcript of a lecture. Provide a short title for a note on this topic. Shorter and quippier is always better.

- "Git Mastery" is better than "How to use Git to manage your codebase" or "Mastering Git and GitHub"
  - "Git Mastery" is the better title because it's shorter and more memorable than the other two.

This will be a filename, so only use characters which can make a valid filename (Spaces are fine, but no slashes, or anything that would actually make it invalidâ€¦)
