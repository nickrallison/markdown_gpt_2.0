Below is a transcript of a lecture. Provide a short title for a note on this topic. Shorter is always better, but keep it professional. It can be as short as one word if that is adequate to describe the topic. Prefer basic terms in the title, avoid jargon or complex terms.

- "Git Basics" is a good title, "Git Good" is not.
  - "Git Good" is a meme, and not a professional title, it is also not descriptive of the content.
  - Whereas "Git Basics" is a simple and descriptive title.
- "Quantum Mechanics" is a good title, "Quantum Mechanics and its implications on the Schrodinger Equation" is not.
  - The second title is too long and complex, the first is simple and descriptive.

This will be a filename, so only use characters which can make a valid filename (Spaces are fine, but no slashes, or anything that would actually make it invalidâ€¦)
