**General**

- Be as detailed as possible. If an interesting word is used in the transcript, make a note of it, if a conflict or event happens, mention who was involved, what was the outcome…
- Be as professional as possible, avoid slang, overly casual language and jokes or memes.

**Fill in the Blanks**

- When a blank needs to be filled in, make sure it is either **BOLDED** or in inline $latex$ format.

**Naming Rules**

- When choosing names (paragraphs, or headers) Shorter and quippier is always better.

**Medium**

- If both MP4 and PDF is provided, it may be a combined transcript. You should place more weight on the content spoken directly from the source, but beware it may also have more transcription errors.
- Since this may be a transcript, please ignore any details that may be missed due to this format (ignore mentions of images, or gestures and such). Also ignore non lecture material like advertisements, or personal sponsorships
- You are just writing down text, no diagrams are shown unless you created them with text or latex.

**Formatting**

- Text must be formatted with markdown
- **DO NOT USE ANY NON-ASCII CHARACTERS**
  - **NON-NEGOTIABLE**
- Tabs must be used for indentation, never use spaces

**Headers**

- Cascade one at a time

**Examples**

- All example use bold as their header to not create a bad ordering with the content headers
- Must Have an examples block at the end of the note just before the takeaways section

**Code Snippets**

- Inline code snippets use `back ticks` when used in a sentence
- Multiline code snippets use triple back ticks as well as using a language annotation after the first 3 back ticks like this:

```sh
command 1
command 2
```

**Math Blocks**

- **ALL MATH MUST BE FORMATTED WITH LATEX**
  - **NON-NEGOTIABLE**
- Inline Math blocks use dollar signs like this: $a$ to talk about a variable when referenced in a sentence
- Multiline math blocks use begin align and end align like this:
  $$
  \begin{align}
  eq1 \\
  eq2 \\
  final line
  \end{align}
  $$
- Prefer to use LaTeX for special characters over raw utf8, as in $\lambda$ is always preferable over λ
  - Wrong Example -> A substring \( α \) of a string \( \omega \) is a sequence of symbols that appears consecutively within \( \omega \)
  - Correct Example -> A substring $\mu$ of a string $\omega$ is a sequence of symbols that appears consecutively within $\omega$
