## Introduction

Introduction paragraph. Sentence 1â€¦.
Maybe a fill in the blank comes **here**
A fill in the blank could also be inline like this $blank$

## Header for Body Paragraph 1

to do some code thing you can run this command:

```bash
command [argument]
```

More text about the command

**Header of Body Paragraph 1 Example:**

Here is an example usage of `command`:

```bash
command filename
```

### Header for Subparagraph 1 of Body Paragraph 1

Here is a tangentially related command that does something different

```
command [argument] [different type of argument]
```

More text about the command

**Header of Subparagraph 1 of Body Paragraph 1 Example:**

```
command filename path
```

Explanation about the command

#### Header for Sub-Subparagraph 1 of Subparagraph 1 of Body Paragraph 1

There can be as many levels of headers as needed, use these freely.

## Header for Body Paragraph 2

Maybe there is a math example, if so here is a block of math:

$$
\begin{align}
\text{text within an equation can go here} \\
\text{math} = \text{goes here} \\
e = mc^2\\
A = \pi r^2
\end{align}
$$

subsequent explanation can go here, maybe we want to talk about $A$, $\pi$, or even something more complicated like $e=mc^2$

**Header of Body Paragraph 2 Example:**

$$
\begin{align}
r = 10\text{cm} \\
A = \pi (10\text{cm})^2 \\
A = 314.15\text{cm}^2
\end{align}
$$

### Header for Subparagraph 1 of Body Paragraph 2

Maybe there is a related / sub formula to talk about:

$$
\begin{align}
V = l \times w \times h
\end{align}
$$

**Header of Subparagraph 1 of Body Paragraph 2 Example:**

$$
\begin{align}
l = 5 \text{cm} \\
l = 8 \text{cm} \\
l = 2 \text{cm} \\
V = 5 \text{cm} \times 8 \text{cm} \times 2 \text{cm} \\
V = 80\text{cm}^3
\end{align}
$$

## Takeaways

- **Git Initialization**: Use `git init` to create a new local Git repository.
- **Staging Files**: Use `git add <file>` to stage files for commit.
- **Committing Changes**: Use `git commit -m "message"` to commit staged changes.
- **.gitignore**: Use a `.gitignore` file to prevent certain files from being tracked.
- **Undoing Changes**: Use `git reset` to undo commits; `git reset --hard` is more destructive.
- **Branching**: Use `git branch <branch_name>` to create a new branch and `git checkout <branch_name>` to switch to it.
- **Merging**: Use `git merge <branch_name>` to merge branches; handle conflicts by editing the conflicting files.
- **Rebasing**: Use `git rebase <branch_name>` to rebase a branch; resolve conflicts similarly to merges.
- **GitHub**: Use `git remote add origin <url>` and `git push -u origin main` to push to GitHub.
- **Cloning**: Use `git clone <url>` to clone a repository.
- **Forking and Pull Requests**: Fork a repository, make changes, and create a pull request to contribute back.

These notes should provide a comprehensive overview of the lecture on Git basics and advanced techniques.
